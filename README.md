## How to Run

All code is contained in a single Jupyter notebook:

📁 *File Name:* HomeWork_5_All_Ques.ipynb  
✅ Designed for Google Colab (recommended) or any local Python environment.

---

## Video Demonstration

A short video (2–3 minutes) explaining the code, architecture, and results for each task:
